# Clock frequency divider

Example project for a clock frequency divider using a Papilio One board.

The input frequency used for the divider is the 32 MHz operating frequency of the Papilio One, and it is reduced to 1 Hz.
The reduced frequency is sent out through one of the board's pins, which is then connected to an LED.
A *reset* input was also added using a push button, which reset the frequency counter to 0, and turned the output off.

A short video showing the project running can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgwjHOryijY "Papilio One seven segment example")
